        <h3>
          Profile Verification Information &#91;Including Biometric
          Information&#93;
        </h3>
        <p>
          For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user
          experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask
          for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that
          you carry out{" "}
          <a href="https://One Night Stand.com/en/help/how-can-i-verify-my-profile">
            photo verification
          </a>
          . We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid
          fake One Night Stand accounts being created which can be used for
          malicious activities and cybercrime &shy; they threaten the One Night
          Stand network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might
          be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify
          your photo on a voluntary basis &#91;to add the blue ‘verified &apos;
          badge to your profile&#93;.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo
          that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition
          technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile
          photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add
          the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that
          we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes
          until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years
          after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the
          applicable retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable
          steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Purchases Information</h3>
        <p>
          If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process
          your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention
          of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          One Night Stand uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment
          transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In
          order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour
          that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a
          transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and
          Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction
          is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically
          be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified
          that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can
          contact One Night Stand to contest the decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any
          account&#91;s&#93; that you have on other One Night Stand Group
          platforms/applications, such as Badoo, may also be blocked as part of
          our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.

        <p>
          If you have given One Night Stand access to your location in your

          about WiFi access points as well as other location information about
          your longitude and latitude and may save your device &apos;s
          coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps
          us identify your physical location and we use it to personalise the
          App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by
          enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users
          seeing your profile and showing you the profiles of other Users who
          are near you.

        <h3>Processing we perform to improve services for students</h3>
        <p>
          We process personal data to understand which of our users may be in
          college or university. To do this, we collect information regarding
          whether you have used the App somewhere in a broad geographic area
          around a university. We keep a simple “student yes/no” indication
          based on our findings. No other information is collected and nothing
          is shared outside One Night Stand. Please note that we do not record
          your precise location as part of this processing and we permanently
          erase the usage data shortly after collection. We &apos;ll combine
          this information with other relevant information we hold for the
          following purposes: so we can send the right offers, events and
          features to the right users; to understand which One Night Stand
          events are popular with the student demographic and which aren &apos;t
          working so well; and to improve the design of the App to meet the
          needs of students, based on the way they like to use the App. The
          legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests. We have a
          legitimate interest in providing a more tailored app experience for
          student users and in optimising their chances of finding the right
          connections. Please note this processing only affects One Night Stand
          users located in the United States.

        <h3>Marketing Services Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We partner with providers of marketing services &#91;such as Facebook
          for example&#93; &#91;‘Marketing Services Providers &apos;&#93; to
          help us market and advertise our App and services on third party
          websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our
          advertising campaigns. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new
            users, if you already have a One Night Stand account;
          </li>
          <li>
            to show One Night Stand adverts to users who have visited the One
            Night Stand App/Sites but haven &apos;t yet created a One Night
            Stand account;
          </li>
          <li>
            to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential
            users who have similar characteristics to you based on the
            information the Marketing Service Providers holds about you
            &#91;also known as a Lookalike Audience&#93;; or
          </li>
          <li>
            to include you in a ‘custom audience &apos; that will receive One
            Night Stand advertising content &#91;a custom audience is
            essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be

        <p>

            the advertising identifier associated with your device &#91;this is
            a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer &#91;for
            example Apple or Google&#93; to your device to help advertisers
            &#91;including the manufacturer&#93; know when an ad has been viewed
            or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion &apos;
            &#91;for example, downloading the app advertised to you&#93;&#93;
          </li>
          <li>your estimated location &#91;based on your IP address&#93;</li>

            with our App&#93;
          </li>
          <li>
            a hashed* version of your email address &#91;to create ‘custom
            audiences &apos;&#93;.
          </li>
          <br />
          <p>
            *Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a
            combination of random numbers and letters - this code cannot be
            traced back to the email address. When hashed email addresses are
            sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they &apos;re then matched
            against the Provider &apos;s own existing list of their own users
            &apos; hashed information and our ads are served to those of our
            users who have successfully been matched with the Provider &apos;s.
            Matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.

          California &apos;s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83,
          requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California
          customers asking about the businesses &apos; practices related to
          disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties
          &apos; direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any

          From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we
          may, if you participate in such promotion, disclose your contact
          information to the third party to allow them to market their products

          exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a

        <h2>12. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION.</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the
          legal basis relied upon &#91;as set out in Section 2 above&#93; and as
          permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification
          Information &#91;Including Biometric Information&#93;” in Section 1,
          above, to learn about our retention policy with respect to biometric
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in
          the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your
          Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the
          process of deleting your personal information from our systems,
          unless:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            we must keep it to comply with applicable law &#91;for instance, if
            you make purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept
            for tax and accounting purposes&#93;;
          </li>
          <li>
            we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law
            &#91;for example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account
            information and a record of the behaviour that led to the block -
            this information is retained for evidential purposes in case of
            queries or legal claims concerning the block&#93;;
          </li>
          <li>
            there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep
            the relevant information until it is resolved; or
          </li>
          <li>
            the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests,
            such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users &apos; safety and
            security &#91;for example, information may need to be kept to
            prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security
            incidents from opening a new account&#93;.

        </ol>
        <p>
          <b>Warning:</b> Even after you remove information from your profile or
          delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable
          and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously
          shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control
          this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third
          party applications or websites access to your personal information,
          they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their
          terms of service or privacy policies.
